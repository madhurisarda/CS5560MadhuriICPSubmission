Existing cellular communications and the upcoming 5G mobile network requires meeting high-reliability standards, very low latency, higher capacity, more security, and high-speed user connectivity. Mobile operators are looking for a programmable solution that will allow them to accommodate multiple independent tenants on the same physical infrastructure and 5G networks allow for end-to-end network resource allocation using the concept of Network Slicing (NS). Data-driven decision making will be vital in future communication networks due to the traffic explosion and Artificial Intelligence (AI) will accelerate the 5G network performance. In this paper, we have developed a ‘DeepSlice’ model by implementing Deep Learning (DL) Neural Network to manage network load efficiency and network availability, utilizing in-network deep learning and prediction. We use available network Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to train our model to analyze incoming traffic and predict the network slice for an unknown device type. Intelligent resource allocation allows us to use the available resources on existing network slices efficiently and offer load balancing. Our proposed DeepSlice model will be able to make smart decisions and select the most appropriate network slice, even in case of a network failure.
