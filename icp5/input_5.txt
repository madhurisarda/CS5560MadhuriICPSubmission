The multitude of 5th generation network applications, use cases and services shall have Network Slicing playing a key role in their enablement. Network slicing shall provide end-to-end isolation between the slices. This feature shall provide the ability to customize each of the slices based on the service needs such as bandwidth and latency. The slices maintaining isolation between resource allocation and traffic shall be critically important in protecting the network infrastructure system against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Systems shall need to adapt to more secured security mechanisms and policies to build a robust 5G network. We are proposing a framework for ‘Secured 5G’ Neural Network creating a robust network slicing architecture. The proposed framework shall enable proactive detection and elimination of threats using deep learning techniques prior to the infestation of the core network. We shall develop a model that enables the threat to be quarantines ensuring end-toend security from device to the core network.
